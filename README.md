To tackle your project on creating "Roboprof," an intelligent agent for answering university-related questions using a knowledge graph and NLP, follow these steps:

### 1. **Plan Your Project**
- **Understand the Assignment:** Ensure every team member understands the goals, structure, and requirements.
- **Assign Roles:** Divide the work based on skills in knowledge graph construction, NLP, SPARQL queries, and programming.
- **Set Milestones:** Outline deadlines for each phase, including knowledge base construction, NLP interface development, and integration.

### 2. **Construct the Knowledge Base**
- **Develop the RDF Schema:** Use RDFS to define the structure of your knowledge graph, capturing universities, courses, lectures, topics, and students.
- **Create SPARQL Queries:** Design queries to test your schema and to fulfill the requirement of answering specific questions about courses, topics, and students.
- **Populate with Data:** Start with Concordia's courses, especially COMP 474/6741, including detailed information about lectures, topics, etc.

### 3. **Develop the NLP Interface**
- **Choose NLP Tools:** Select appropriate NLP libraries or frameworks that can process natural language questions and interact with your knowledge graph.
- **Implement Question Parsing:** Develop functionality to parse user questions and map them to SPARQL queries against your knowledge graph.
- **Refine Responses:** Ensure the system can translate query results back into understandable responses.

### 4. **Integrate and Test**
- **Combine Components:** Integrate the knowledge base, SPARQL queries, and NLP interface into a single system.
- **Conduct Tests:** Perform comprehensive testing, including unit tests for individual components and integration tests for the entire system.
- **Gather Feedback:** If possible, get feedback from potential users and refine your system based on their input.

### 5. **Prepare Deliverables**
- **Documentation:** Create a README file detailing how to set up and use your system, including any dependencies.
- **Report Writing:** Write the project report, summarizing your approach, challenges faced, and how they were overcome.
- **Prepare for Demo:** Get ready for the on-campus demo, ensuring all team members can present and explain the system effectively.

### 6. **Review and Submit**
- **Final Review:** Go over all components and documentation to ensure completeness and adherence to the assignment requirements.
- **Academic Integrity:** Double-check your submission for proper citations and adherence to academic integrity guidelines.
- **Submit:** Turn in your RDF schema, dataset, Python programs, knowledge base, query results, README, and project report by the due date.

Remember, communication within your team is key to managing the workload and meeting deadlines. Good luck!
