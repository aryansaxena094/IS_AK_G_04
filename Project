The document is a detailed project assignment for the course COMP 474/6741 Intelligent Systems (Winter 2024), focusing on creating "Roboprof," an intelligent agent capable of answering university-related questions using a knowledge graph and natural language processing. Here are the key points:

Due Date: Tuesday, March 19th, 2024. It counts for 50% of the course project.
Goal: Build Roboprof to answer questions about courses, students, and topics at a university using a knowledge graph and NLP.
Project Structure:
The initial assignment focuses on constructing the knowledge base.
Subsequent phases involve refining this base, developing the NLP interface, and integrating components into a cohesive system.
Knowledge Graph Vocabulary Requirements: Information about universities, courses, lectures, topics, and students, utilizing RDF and RDFS standards. Specifics include:
Universities: Names and links to DBpedia/Wikidata entries.
Courses: Name, subject, number, credits, description, and links to additional information.
Lectures: Number, name, content (slides, worksheets, readings, etc.), and links to information.
Topics: Name, provenance information, and links to DBpedia/Wikidata.
Students: Name, ID, email, completed courses with grades, and competencies based on completed courses.
Tasks:Create a vocabulary using RDFS to capture the required information.

Design SPARQL queries to validate the vocabulary and enable Roboprof to answer specific questions related to courses, topics, and students.
Populate the knowledge base with information about Concordia's courses and additional material for COMP 474/6741 and another selected course.
Configure a query server using Apache Fuseki and document query sample outputs.
Deliverables: RDF schema, dataset, Python program(s) for KB construction, the complete knowledge base, queries and their results, a README file, and a project report.
Project Demo: Scheduled demo sessions on campus, with all team members present.
Grading Policy: Assumes equal contribution from team members but outlines procedures for addressing disputes over contributions.
Academic Integrity: Strict guidelines on originality, citing external sources, usage of LLMs like ChatGPT, collaboration vs. copying, and ensuring private repositories.
This assignment emphasizes constructing a comprehensive knowledge graph and developing an NLP interface to facilitate an educational assistant capable of querying university-related information.
